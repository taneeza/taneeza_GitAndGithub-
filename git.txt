Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually
 used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
 Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands
 of parallel branches running on different systems).

GitHub is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides
 the distributed version control of Gits access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task
 management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it has been
  a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.
